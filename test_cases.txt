# TEST CASES FOR CHESS GAME WITH AI

# 1. ChessBoard Class

# Test 1.1: Initial Board Setup
# Input: Initialize a ChessBoard object.
# Expected Output: 
# - All pieces are in their standard starting positions.
# - Castling rights are set to True for both players.
# - No en passant flags set.
# Edge Case: None (Standard setup).

# Test 1.2: Legal Move Generation
# Input: Call generate_legal_moves('white') for the starting board.
# Expected Output:
# - 20 legal moves (16 pawn moves and 4 knight moves).
# Edge Cases:
# - Generate legal moves for a player in check (ensure moves resolve check).
# - Generate legal moves with pinned pieces (ensure they cannot leave the king in check).

# Test 1.3: Path Clearance
# Input: Call is_path_clear((0, 0), (0, 7)) on a starting board.
# Expected Output: False (rook is blocked by pawns).
# Edge Cases:
# - Path blocked by one piece.
# - Path clear for diagonals, ranks, and files.

# Test 1.4: Check Detection
# Input: Place the Black King at (0, 0) and a White Rook at (0, 7). Call is_check('black').
# Expected Output: True (Black King is under attack).
# Edge Case:
# - Multiple attackers on the king.

# Test 1.5: Special Moves
# En Passant:
# - Input: Move White Pawn from (4, 6) to (4, 4). Black Pawn moves from (3, 4) to (3, 5).
#   Call generate_legal_moves('white').
# - Expected Output: En passant move available for White Pawn at (4, 4).
# Castling:
# - Input: Ensure castling conditions are met and call generate_legal_moves('white').
# - Expected Output: Castling moves (O-O and O-O-O) are available.
# Pawn Promotion:
# - Input: Move White Pawn to the last rank and execute promotion.
# - Expected Output: Prompts for promotion; board reflects the selected piece.

# Test 1.6: Checkmate and Stalemate
# Checkmate:
# - Input: King surrounded by enemy pieces and unable to escape (e.g., Back Rank Mate).
# - Expected Output: is_checkmate() returns True.
# Stalemate:
# - Input: King has no legal moves, but is not in check.
# - Expected Output: is_stalemate() returns True.

# 2. ChessAI Class

# Test 2.1: Random Move Generation (Easy AI)
# Input: Call generate_move(board, 'easy') for the starting board.
# Expected Output: Returns a legal random move.
# Edge Case: Ensure all generated moves are valid under current board state.

# Test 2.2: Board Evaluation (Medium AI)
# Input: Evaluate board states with:
# - King safety
# - Material balance
# - Piece activity
# Expected Output: Heuristic scores align with positional advantages.

# Test 2.3: Minimax Algorithm (Hard AI)
# Input: Call generate_move(board, 'hard') for a midgame position.
# Expected Output: Move selected aligns with optimal minimax decisions.
# Edge Case: Depth-limited pruning in complex positions.

# 3. GameController Class

# Test 3.1: Turn Management
# Input: Execute a move and check the turn indicator.
# Expected Output: Alternates between "White's Turn" and "Black's Turn."
# Edge Case: Skip turn after stalemate detection.

# Test 3.2: Game Over Conditions
# Input: Setup a board state where Black is checkmated and call check_game_over().
# Expected Output: Outputs "Checkmate! White wins."
# Edge Cases:
# - Stalemate detection.
# - Insufficient material (e.g., King vs. King).

# 4. GUI Interactions

# Test 4.1: Board Rendering
# Input: Call draw_board(screen) after executing moves.
# Expected Output: Correct rendering of all pieces at updated positions.
# Edge Case: Test rendering after pawn promotion and castling.

# Test 4.2: Move Highlighting
# Input: Call highlight_moves(valid_moves) for a selected piece.
# Expected Output: Correct squares are highlighted.
# Edge Cases:
# - Highlighting during check scenarios.
# - No moves available for selected piece.

# Test 4.3: User Feedback
# Input: Call display_message("Checkmate!") during game over.
# Expected Output: Message is displayed on screen.
# Edge Case: No overlapping messages during gameplay.

# 5. End-to-End Test Cases

# Test 5.1: Human vs. AI (Easy)
# Input: Play a game where the user and AI alternate turns.
# Expected Output: Game adheres to rules, and AI responds within 1 second.

# Test 5.2: Human vs. AI (Hard)
# Input: Set AI difficulty to Hard and play from midgame.
# Expected Output: AI makes calculated moves; ensures no illegal moves.

# Test 5.3: Special Moves Sequence
# Input: Play a game that includes castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
